Exercise 1

Create a window application in JavaFX
It is necessary to draw a snowman based on the user's wishes. The snowman consists of circles.
Each subsequent circle is above the previous one, touching it (!). If the circle is pushed to another circle, or there is a space between them, then the snowman is not correctly drawn. Radii of circles are randomized.
Circle colors should be randomized.
On the head of a snowman (the upper circle) from the circles should be drawn a nose and 2 eyes (less than the head).
Circles on the body should be randomized. There is no sequence to decrease or increase.
Data is entered via the console:
     number of circles
     min. radius of a circle
     Max. radius of a circle
